<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This website was built for a hypothetical client interested in showcasing his studio photography work. His express wishes were for a clean professional looking site that is easy to navigate and puts his work front and center. He also provided a short bio he wanted included on the site and wished for a contact form to be able to generate a list of potential clients. Finally, he provided a list of previous customer's feedback to be added on a seperate page as a testimonials section.

In summary the site should contain these basic sections:

<ol>
  <li>Home / Landing page showcasing primary work</li>
  <li>About section with hero image to introduce the photographer</li>
  <li>Gallery Page to show primary selected work</li>
  <li>Testimonials page to show previous satisfied customers</li>
  <li>Contact page / form to allow contacting the photographer</li>
</ol>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Accessing the Site

The finished site is hosted with gitpages under:

<br>
<a href="https://a-hoenig.github.io/Project-One/">William Cooke Photography</a>
<br/>

## User Experience

To ease navigation, standard practices were used to allow the visitor quick access to the site pages via a Navigation bar. 

In keeping with the 'mobile first' philosophy, on smaller screens the Navbar is consolidated into a 'menu burger icon' that presents a drop down view of the navigation bar when pressed.

Other elements such as the Photographer's signature, the contact button and copyright info are all dynamically sized to make full use of the available screen realestate.

Hover events are utilized thoughout to give feedback to the user that they are interacting with a clickable button.

Bold Font in the navigation bar visibly informs the user which page they are on.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The web interface was deliberately chosen with a monochrome dark grey and white look to offset the interface and provide a contrast to the pictures being presented.
Tht color #fafafa was used for text and button elements to reduce the stark contrast of pure white on black.

### Typography

2 Fonts are used on the site for minimalist design. 

<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat">Montserrat</a> Used for all site text and headings.

![Montserrat Font Example](assets/readme-images/montserrat-sample.png)

<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Freehand?query=freehand">Freehand</a> Used only for the Site Title and the photographers signature.

![Freehand Font Example](assets/readme-images/freehand-sample.png)

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>


### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

![Contact Page](assets/readme-images/mockup-contact.png)

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

#### The Home Page

The home page serves as the landing page and aims to impress the visitor with a striking studio portrait image that fills the screen on a minimal interface. The bold white text instantly informs the visitor what the purpose of the site is.

![Home page image](assets/readme-images/screenshot-home.jpg)

The navigation bar and footer are fixed to keep the site controls always visible. 

A single white centered arrow invites the user to scroll down to view the next section - in this case the about summary of the photographer.

#### The About Section

![About Page image](assets/readme-images/screenshot-about.jpg)

The about section shows a self portrait of the Photographer and his welcome text to invite you in and share his passion. The text dynamically adjusts around the circular photo on larger screens.

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

#### The Gallery Page

The gallery page is designed to put the pictures first on a clean well ordered canvas. Only minimal margins are used to allow maximum content. The columns dynamically adjust using HTML flex properties to adjust to all screen sizes. For phone displays only a single column is used with each picture taking up the full width. 

A simple white border is used as a mouse over effect to highlight a specific picture the user is interested in.

![Gallery Page](assets/readme-images/screenshot-gallery.jpg)

#### The Testimonials Page

This page uses a marquee effect of vertically scrolling text to showcase previous customers feedback. The text is scolled in a simple transparent frame that dynamically resizes for screen realestate.

![Testimonials Page Image](assets/readme-images/screenshot-testimonials.jpg)

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

#### The Contact Page

The contact form invites the user to fill in their details and select what type of photoshoot they might be interested in. The form dynamically resizes to the left on larger screens to keep the interface manageable. The same form background styling is used as throughout the site.

![Contact Page image](assets/readme-images/screenshot-contact.jpg)

#### Future Implementations

Future developement of the site would include:

1. Clickable images in the gallery to present a photo on full screen.
2. Left and right arrows to allow the user to step through the images.
3. Dynamic effects and display of the pop up menu should be animated to make the transition less abrupt and convey a further sense of professionalism.
4. Automated slide show of a collection of landing images to offer some variety on the main homepage.

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

## Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Using detailed alt descriptions of all images and adding aria-labels for navigational elements where neccessary.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

#### HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

#### CSS
  - No major errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

  a single parse error is returned that could not be resolved. Research into the correct syntax of the circle() property (used to align the text around the circular image in the about section) indicates the correct use of the property. Nevertheless, the instruction works as intended.

### Accessibility

An accessibility score of 100 was achieved when anaylsing the site using Google Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse.

![Chrome Lighthouse Results](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-result.png)

<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>



### Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on three most popular browsers for functionality:

![Most Popular Browsers](assets/readme-images/popular-browsers.png)

The only issue regarding browser support was found with safari. On both desktop and mobile versions of Safari, the marquee scrolling feature used in the testimonials page is a little rough and does not scroll smooth. On all other broswers, the feature rendered with no issues.

 <pre>|       SAFARI        |         CHROME         |          EDGE           |</pre>
![Safari rough scroll](assets/readme-images/scroll.gif)


### Known / Fixed Bugs

* When expanding the browser window the burger icon jumps imperceptibily whe passing the 768px screen width media query. This is most likely due to the fact that the header element is switched to a different grid spacing and the align-items: center; overrides the burger-label top:; property. -- **SOLVED** by adjusting the percentage sizes of the header grid.

* on the gallery page when displaying a 2 column grid, the flex property aligning the individual photos leaves a blank slot after the 5th photo. (start of a new div) - **SOLVED**

A solution was implemented using flex grow on a single div that automativally arranges the pictures into strechable columns. The page now dynamically adjusts equal sized tiles to fill the screen thus removing the need for media queries and allowing for dynamic columns and rows as needed. (solution found under: <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/responsive-image-gallery-css-flexbox/">Click here</a> )
